      <description>Introduction The data in this project consists of two separate data sets. The first data set is a list of Wikipedia articles. The Wikipedia articles can be different depending on the choosing of an initial starting page. In this data set however, the initial starting page is pre-selected as the Wikipedia page for Albert Einstein. The first data set is thus a network consisting of the articles that can be reached by clicking the links on the pages within 2 clicks.</description>

      <description>Introduction We have the data, so we should begin by learning a bit about the properties of the networks extracted from the data. The things we are interested in are things like the average degree of a node, the size of the giant components in the data, weak and strong. We also want to know something about the connectivity of the nodes. Which nodes have the highest in- and out-degree? What does the node distribution look like?</description>
