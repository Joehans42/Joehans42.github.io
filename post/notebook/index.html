<li>The data</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The first data set that I am using for this project consists of the list of wikipedia articles, which can be reached in 2 clicks from the Albert Einstein Wikipedia page. This data set has 65233 articles (nodes) with 98707 links between each other (edges). The second data set is a data set from the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP). The data set contains human navigation paths on Wikipedia which have been obtained through the Wikispeedia game. In Wikispeedia, the objective is to navigate from a source article to a target article by clicking links on the pages. Here they have used a condensed version of Wikipedia where only 4604 articles are used. SNAP has provided both the full navigation paths for these speedruns as well as the full plaintext of each article. Source: <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wikispeedia.html">http://snap.stanford.edu/data/wikispeedia.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reasoning</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I chose these data sets because I have done Wikipedia speedruns myself and found it very interesting what the optimal path to a given target from a given source might be. The acquired data can tell us not only what the optimal route to a given target is, but the SNAP dataset can also give us insight into what the human method for finding the target with limited knowledge of the links. A human might commonly go to pages that are associated with the target in order to get there, since they cannot possibly know every single page that links to the target, like going to a home city or home country of a person they are looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Goal</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal is to see which pages are commonly clicked on in order to reach a given target. If a page is clicked often in speedruns then it might be a hub that can lead to the target more often in other speedruns. Since we in the data also have unfinished paths we can look at which paths might more often lead to not finding the target.</p>

<p>Cleaning the data</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For the base Wikipedia data set I used json and regular expressions as we did in the Zelda data set. Using the Wikipedia API we can get the entire page html including links. We can then use the regular expressions to get all the articles linked to. The regular expression used here simply says: Take [[anything]] between two sets of square brackets as long as the square brackets don&rsquo;t contain things like &lsquo;File:&rsquo; or &rsquo;s:', since those denote other things such as images and other language pages. It also prevents obtaining links with a &lsquo;#&rsquo; since they refer to a specific subsection of a page and not the entire page itself. We also prevent the actual text that you would see if you read the article, which is separated by a &lsquo;|&rsquo;, since it might be different from the link.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>SNAP data set</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For the SNAP data set we don&rsquo;t need to download anything with the API or look for the links on every page. We have already been given a list of all the articles and a list of every single link between those pages. We simply need to load them into a pandas dataframe and clean up the text a bit. As it turns out, many of the pages have special characters such as the first page: Áedán mac Gabráin, so we parse all the names of nodes and get rid of the percentage notation that is commonly used for URLs. As it turns out for both the data sets, the amount of data is simply too big for visualisations to be handled in python, so we will instead sample parts of the data for visualisation of the network.</p>

<p>Firstly we want to visualize the base Wikipedia data set network, so we can get a feeling of how it looks, where the nodes are in relation to each other and if there are any nodes with a degree of 0 i.e. not connected to the rest of the graph.</p>

<li>Tool (networkx.draw, sampling &amp; Pyvis)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The tools I used to try and visualize the network are the networkx package which we have used earlier in the course and then I have made use of Pyvis, which makes interactive graphs where you can zoom in and see the different links between the nodes more clearly. As we will see in this section, both the data sets are too big to plot properly, so I have made use of random sampling with Pythons random package.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We saw in this section, that simply collecting all the links from a Wikipedia page makes a way too large network where the amount of nodes explodes exponentially very quickly. And while the SNAP data set has far fewer nodes, it has even more edges, which is hard to visualize in Python. Looking at the plotted network image, the graph is way to large and it takes way too much computing power to run. We can make out a few of the nodes, but not much information can be gathered. However, when we make use of sampling we can get an idea, although incomplete, of what the full graph might look like. We see that there is one giant connected component in the middle with most of the nodes in it. However we also see a decent amount of nodes with degree 1, 2 or 3 outside of the giant connected component.</p>

<p>Now we would like to know a little more about the network and its nodes and connections. It might be interesting to see what kind of nodes are the most connected in the network and just how connected they are. We would also like to look at the degree distribution of the network.</p>

<p>The tool I used to extract this information is the SNAP tool which the creators of the SNAP data set use themselves to make calculations about the data. I have already created a graph &lsquo;G1&rsquo; using SNAP, but I will also create a new graph &lsquo;G2&rsquo; with the same data using networkx, since SNAP and networkx have different functions that can tell us more about the data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this section we got a real good look at the nodes and their connectivity. This graph has turned out to be highly connected with the average node having a degree of ~52. We can also see this by looking at the biggest weakly connected component, which contain almost all of the nodes of the regular network. This is interesting, since the visualisation plot shows a much higher concentration of nodes outside the GCC, but that is to be expected, when we do sampling of the edges in such a large network. We learned that the most connected node &lsquo;United States&rsquo; is connected to 40% of the other nodes, having a degree of 1845. <br><br> What I really wanted to take away from this data set, is what kind of nodes are the most connected in this network, and when looking at the top 20 nodes in terms of degree it is very clear. Countries are the most connected articles in the data, followed closely by categories such as &lsquo;English Language&rsquo;, &lsquo;Scientific classification&rsquo; and &lsquo;Animal&rsquo;. And this makes sense from a speedrunning perspective. Generally you want to get to countries, because important events, things or people from a given country is often linked in the country&rsquo;s article. Another reason why you would want to click on a country is, that it&rsquo;s easy to get to other countries and thus to things from all across the world. Categories also make sense to click on. If you need to find a specific animal like a fox or wolf, it&rsquo;d be useful to get to &lsquo;Animal&rsquo;, since you then have access to every single animal family there is from there. <br><br> The last thing I want to point out is, that it seems many of the countries have a high in-degree compared to out-degree. This would imply that there are a lot of paths that <strong>come</strong> from many different smaller nodes but lead <strong>away</strong> from the node through the same links. You could also say that there are of course a lot of smaller pages that link to more general pages such as country, which do not link back. An example could be a celebrity who is from the United States will almost certainly have a link to &lsquo;United States&rsquo;, but &lsquo;United States&rsquo; will likely not have a link back. Pages are of course also limited by the amount of links they actually have. If we take the United States as an example again. While we have 1845 links to the page in our data set alone (there are a lot more in all of Wikipedia no doubt), the out-degree of the page itself is upperbounded by how many links are actually on the page. But the point is that these big countries naturally become hubs, since they can be reached from so many different pages.</p>

<li>What went well?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I am pleased with how the visualisation plot turned out. It is very interesting to see how close some things are connected that you would think have nothing to do with each other, but can still be reached with 3 or 4 clicks, simply because they are people living in certain places or with connections to certain people. I think sampling the edgelist and plotting with Pyvis also went very well.</p>

<li>Improvements</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I would like to have done some sort of text analysis on the pages, although I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly there is to analyse in the text on a Wikipedia page. It might be possible to look at something like in this <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~west1/pubs/West-Pineau-Precup_IJCAI-09.pdf">paper</a>, where researchers have inferred semantic distances between concepts using Wikispeedia. However I believe that would be outside the scope of this course.<br><br> Another thing I would have liked to look at are the paths that speedrunners actually take. What I&rsquo;ve analysed here was simply just the links between the gathered articles. While they are gathered from the routes, they don&rsquo;t say that much about the actual routes taken. A part of the data set is the actual paths taken by speedrunners. The file contains both the hashed IP address of the speedrunner, the duration it took, the path through the articles and a rating from 1-5 depending on how hard it was perceived. There are about 51.3k paths in all. I could imagine looking into which paths are most commonly used, which ones are harder and maybe you could do a mapping of the easiest and hardest paths. There is also a similar data set of unfinished paths, where people have either timed out or restarted. Analysing those could give an idea of which paths are a bad idea to take. That data set seems a little broken in some places though, so it might be hard to load.<br><br> A <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~west1/pubs/West-Leskovec_WWW-12.pdf">study</a> on human wayfinding in information networks found that human wayfinding differs from the shortest paths. Most subjects navigate through high-degree hubs in the early phase, while their search is guided by content features thereafter. This would be very interesting to look at also.</p>
